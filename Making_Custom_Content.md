# Making Custom Content Swinburne AstroTour Theatres
The astrotour 3D Theatre interface allows you to easily add in new content in
the form of videos, images, and even applications.  This short manual is a
guide to adding your own content to your own installation of astrotour.

## The Astrotour Directory Structure
Your astrotour should reside in a single directory, possible `~/swinburne`.
Within this directory, we have a number of files and menus:

```
astrosync.sh
astrotour/
bin/
config/
custom/
s2plot/
```
The important directories for us are `astrotour/` and `custom/`.  These are
going to contain both configuration files we will need to edit to add our
content, and the content itself once we've added it.

Both of these directories contain an identical set of subdirectories as
follows:

```
Apps/
Menus/
Movies/
```
While these are fairly self-explanatory, it's important to note that still 
images are actually contained in the `Apps/` directory.
